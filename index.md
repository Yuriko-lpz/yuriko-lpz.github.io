### CPSC 120
* Lab 2

    I really enjoyed Lab 2 because it was the first time we started writing actual code. I tried my best to finish this lab, and I felt proud of the result. I liked learning about strings and how to use std::cin to get input from the user and std::cout to print messages. I also enjoyed making the program like the Mad Libs game. I had never heard about this game before because I am from Peru, so it was fun to learn about it while coding. 

* Lab 4 Part 2

    I liked Lab 4 Part 2 because we started using if statement. It was difficult at first, but I understood more as I kept coding. This lab helped me learn how to use if statements to make decisions in a program, which is important in coding. The guessing game was fun to make, and I felt very excited and proud when I finished it.


* Lab 10

    I need to admit that Lab10 was difficult at first, but I really liked and enjoyed it. I learned how to use 2D vectors to organize and search for data, which helped me understand how coding can handle real-world information. It is really cool to think about how coding is applied in real life, like organizing California county data, and how helpful it can be for important tasks.
